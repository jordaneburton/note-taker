# Note-Taker
An application to write and save notes, powered by Express.js

## Description

The Note Taker app allows you to take notes and save them to a server database. The application's backend is powered by Express.js and allows you to interact with the server through the save and delete buttons. After you craft a note, you can use the save button to send the note to the server, where the note will be saved to a database and added to the website dynamically. However, if you wish to delete a note, you can click the delete button next to a note to remove it from the server's database as well as the web page.
